memory-game-android
===================

A simple memory game for Android based on libGDX

Find it on Google Play here:

How to compile it
-----------------
I'm using IDEA to create three modules: main, desktop, and android.
Dependencies are the repective libraries in the sub directories, and for
desktop and android you'll need the main module. Make sure to tick "export" for
the libs in the main module.
